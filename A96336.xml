         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>HOwl, howl, howl, ye Inhabitants of the Earth; for the voice of God's thunders are gone forth againſt you, and the Lord God is riſen in Jealouſie to plead by the Sword of his Eternal Power, and all muſt know the fire of the Lord God's Indignation to paſs over them, who are found this day oppoſing the work of the Lord God, who will work and none ſhall let him, who ſhall work and none ſhal hinder him; And bleſſed are all who are found clear of oppreſſing the work of the Lord; for verily on whom the Stone falls on, it ſhall grind him to powder; and whoſoever falleth upon it ſhal be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces. And God hath determined the deliverance of his own Seed, which truſteth in his name; and for their ſakes the Lord God, who is a conſuming fire, will break forth ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, to the utter ruine and deſtruction of all his enemies, and all ſhal burn as an Oven; for God is kindling of a fire among the Briers and Brambles of the Earth, an utter conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is coming upon them all: As God brought the Flood in <hi>Noah</hi>'s daies upon the world for the wickedneſs thereof, even ſo is the Lord bringing of an over-flowing ſcourge, which ſhal ſweep away the Wicked by the Beſom of his own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Wo unto the World, and all that are found therein, Judgment is begun already at the Houſe of God, and who ſhall abide the day of his coming, wherein he will ſet as with Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners fire; then ſhall the heavens paſs away as a ſcrowl, with lightning, with thundering, and with earthquakes; then ſhall the elements melt with fervent heat; then ſhal every man's works be tried by fire; and this the Trumpet of the Lord of Hoſts which is blown to you all, dread, fear and tremble before the terrible God, who will ſhake both heaven and earth, who removeth the foundations thereof; and verify the Lord God will roar out of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with a voice of terrible thunder, and at the ſound thereof all the beaſts of the field ſhall tremble; For this is the day of the Lord God, wherein he will ſhake the kingdoms of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the powers thereof ſhal fall, and the Lord onely ſhal be exalted over all: and again will he daſh the potſhards of the earth to pieces; and this day is at hand wherein Overturn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, Overturning ſhal come from the mighty hand of the Lord, and ſuch a down fall is near, as never was the like in the Nation of <hi>England;</hi> this is the Lord's bringing to paſs, that all may know, that onely he alone reigneth over all, who hath power to do whatſoever he will; then ſhal all know that God is in the midſt of the moſt contemptible, deſpiſed remnant, who are not counted worthy to live upon the earth; but bleſſed are they from the Lord God, and they ſhal be bleſſed, although all the enchanters of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſtudy miſchief againſt the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, yet their divinations ſhal not hurt <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor the enchantments proſper againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> the called of God, none ſhal be like unto them; yea, they ſhal ſhine in glory, to the tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Egypts</hi> Dogs, who are barking and biting, who are like Wolves, tearing and renting the Lambs of the Fold of God's everlaſting reſt, but they cannot rent them from the reſt, not pluck them from the Fold, neither can they take any of them out of the hands of the good Shepherd, who watcheth over his both night and day; for the Wolf cometh in the night, ſo the Wolves are in the night.
